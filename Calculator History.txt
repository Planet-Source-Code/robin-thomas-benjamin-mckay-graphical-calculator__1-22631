Calculator 1.0
**************


With Calculator 1.0, all bugs I have found have been
fixed.


Calculator 1.1
**************

Calculator 1.1 has been fixed now -- added a few
bits more code to the "Not" function. I found this
error when I did debug Calculator -- now fixed. 

New error raised by PSC member Chris Selbach: 

"Division by zero error is not handled." 


Thank you to Chris for raising this error -- as of
now, Calculator 1.2 has been developed. In 1.2, I
hope to have this bug fixed. 


Calculator 1.2
**************

The Division By Zero error has now been fixed --
thank you for reporting that error, Chris. 


What's new in 1.2?
******************

* The Division By Zero error has now been fixed.
* Added a new timer control to support this


What's new in 1.3?
******************

* Fixed the division by zero error permanently
* Added a bit more functionality to calculator
* The features message box has been updated to support division by zero
* Added a new "0." so that nought point numbers are supported and do
  not clash with "Divide By Zero" errors. 


Calculator Version 1.4
**********************

* Added Sin, Cos and Tan
* Added a separate bit to work out fractions 
* Sorted out some of the code to lessen the use of Input Boxes

NB: On some of the Sin, Cos and Tan calculations, you may see a -02 at the
end. I am working to fix this right now. I just thought I would mention
this to give everyone piece of mind.

However, if you find any other errors that I have not accounted for, please
report them A.S.A.P. so that I can fix them.


What's coming up in future versions?
************************************

Hopefully, Sin/Cos/Tan will be handled in 1.4. I shall
keep releasing minor versions in the future if bugs
are found. I need your support to make Calculator very
good.


If you find any more errors in Calculator -- they
shall be fixed in future versions. Thank you for
your support over Calculator. I cannot say how
much your support has helped me over the past few
days. If anyone knows how to work out Sin, Cos or
Tan, please let me know. My email is:

Any ideas that you have for the program that you would
like to share with me, please email or fax them to me.
I will consider all ideas before I incorporate them
into the program. I have tried to make this calculator 
as realistic as possible.

Comment: This is a good program -- however Division By
Zero needs to be fixed. 


One Final Thank You
===================

Many thanks for supporting the development and the
deployment of Calculator -- It really does mean a lot

a look at, please let me know.
